# Rust Mahjong

Learning rust by implementing mahjong in it.

WARNING: I am brand new at rust and this codebase is essentially noodling to figure it out, nothing here is optimal or good

# usage

Right now the game starts up, loops through the players as they draw tiles, they discard tiles until they have a complete hand until they call Tsumo and end the game. In future they should be able to call riichi, ron. Pon, Chii, Kan and win using more complicated Yaku.
